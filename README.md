# Data Warehouse with AWS
### Scope
The project scope is to extract data from S3 containers containing logs about songs and webpage usage, move the data
into a RedShift database first into staging tables and from there into dimensional and fact tables.
### Execution
![project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36500094/132995528-a1dd95b5-7250-4d96-86c8-0786f49e20c8.jpg)
This is a simple visualization of the project, with the flow of the data from the S3 containers to the different tables into
the Redshift database.
#### Input data
The input data consists of two S3 containers containing two different datasets
##### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
>song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
>song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
>{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
##### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

>log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
>log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

#### RedShift database
The redshift database contains two staging tables s_events and s_songs that contains all the data extracted from the previous datasets.
Then we have 4 dimensional table users, songs, artists and time and a fact table songplays.
This is the ER schema of these tables:

### Project content
The project consists of three python files and a configuration file:
* create_tables.py : Python script to drop (if already exist) and create the project SQL tables
* etl.py : Script to connect to the S3 containers, move the data into staging tables 
* sql_queries.py : Contains all the queries used into the project
* dwh.cfg : Configuration file with the AWS credentials (to be filled)
### Launch the project
To execute the project first fill the dwh.cfg file with the info of a Redshift cluter and a IAM role with S3 reading permission and access to the redshift cluster. Then execute create_tables.py first and then etl.py
